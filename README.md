# Bibliophiles Paradise

This application allows book lovers to search for and save books they've read, and they can keep a journal of what they've read.  These thoughts can be public or private.  Users can rate books as well, and even discuss the books with other users as well.

The application uses the Flask framework, MySQL, and the Google Books API.
