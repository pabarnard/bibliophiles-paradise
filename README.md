# Bibliophile's Paradise

This application allows book lovers to search for and save books they've read, and they can keep a journal of what they've read.  These thoughts can be public or private.  Users can rate books as well, and even discuss the books with other users as well.

This project will be built in phases:
1. Prototyping (CURRENT PHASE) - building out the wireframe with Balsamiq; this is akin to pitching a proposal
2. Utilizing a database management system (DBMS) and designing the schema - the wireframe will inform the tables and relationships required for the application to run
3. Back end - using the Flask microframework to define the routes, models, and more using the Models-Views-Controllers (MVC) design paradigm
4. Front end - building out the basic HTML *only* and the needed forms and features; no styling will be applied yet
5. Unit testing - utilizing a testing framework (to be determined) to make sure the app works correctly; this is test-driven development (TDD)
6. Logging - to keep track of the app while it runs; this becomes especially important when deploying
7. Stylizing the app - Tailwind CSS will now be applied to make the app mobile-friendly and give a clear user interface (UI) and improve the user experience (UX)
8. Deployment - likely will use AWS and find a suitable domain name
